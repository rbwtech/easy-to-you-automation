## ðŸ”§ Development Tips

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test package imports
python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src'); from easytoyou import IonicubeDecoder; print('âœ… Import successful')"

# Test CLI scripts
python scripts/main.py --help
python scripts/easy4us.py --help

# Run specific tests
pytest tests/test_decoder.py -v

# Test with sample data
mkdir test_data
# Add sample PHP files
python scripts/main.py -u test -p test -s test_data -o test_output -v
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
python scripts/main.py -u user -p pass -s source -v

# Monitor log file
tail -f decoder.log

# Debug with pdb
python -m pdb scripts/main.py -u user -p pass -s source
```

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Check Python path and virtual environment
2. **Test failures**: Ensure all dependencies installed correctly
3. **Linting errors**: Run `black` and `flake8` to fix formatting
4. **Type checking**: Run `mypy` to catch type-related issues
